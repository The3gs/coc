# CoC
This is a simple implementation of the calculus of constructions.

This implementation is a normalization by evaluation type checker with bidirectional type checking, based heavily on the tutorial by David Christensen found [here](https://davidchristiansen.dk/tutorials/nbe/ "Checking Dependent types with Normalization by Evaluation").

## Notes
* This typechecker currently has type in type, and is inconsistent as a formal logic. I have not decided if I care about that in the long term, as I want this to be a programming language over a theorem prover.
